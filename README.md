### Challenge:
This challenge is the build models and routes for a e-commerce backend

# User Story

AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

To get this application working clone the repo and then in the root directory open a terminal command line and type 'npm i' to download the dependencies. 

open a second terminal using cmd and type 'mysql -u root -p. 

next type 'SOURCE db/schema.spl' to create the schema (tables) for your db

next open a integrated bash terminal to the seeds file index.js and run that fle to seed the database. and after the database is seeded open a integrated terminal to the server.js file and type node server.js to open the webserver.

# what i have learnt

This project made me start smoking again.. so will have to quit that. the routing is core component of web dev so need to keep making routes over and over to get the patterning in my mind. the main challenge im finding is pathing and spelling, the concepts are clear in my mind but the issues usually stem from not inputting the correct path or spelling errors in code. 

I do want to work more in the backend than front but will have to work alot to get this style of code worked out. 
=======
next run the express server by typing node server.js.
